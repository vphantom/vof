Really, yet another serialization format?  Yes, but one of the simplest!  This fills a niche use case of ours somewhere between JSON, CBOR and Protocol Buffers with the following goals:

* Easy to implement in a new language (weekend project)
* Low CPU/memory requirements to encode and especially decode
* Smaller output size (even vs JSON+gzip)
* Streamable (unlike Protobuf)
* Compact struct type (unlike CBOR)
* Easy versioning with numbered struct fields (like Protobuf)
* Convention for higher-level types (decimal, datetime, etc.)
* Application-facing references (de-duplication on the wire and in memory)
* Schema-based (writers and readers agree on types out-of-band)
* Enough explicit type information for inspection of unknown data
* Explicit binary-JSON interoperability (like Protobuf)

The name "vanilla" was chosen to symbolize the aim to keep the format as simple and generic as possible.

## Version Control Strategy

The format itself allows for very large numeric sizes and makes room for future more complex types with the concept of reserved tags.  This format is thus forward-compatible with future versions.

Regarding schema evolution, similarly to Google Protocol Buffers, since readers and writers must agree on a format out of band, basic rules must be followed to ensure good forward and backward compatibility:

* Deprecated fields must never be reused;
* Field types may be updated, but only in backwards-compatible ways (i.e. `int` vs `enum`);
* Field IDs must never be reused.

### Specification Status

Release Candidate 4 - 2025-09-19

No structural changes are expected, but some verifications are still needed.  In particular the portability of IEEE floating point numbers is not yet validated.

An IDL is coming to help structure implementations and share schemas.

## ROADMAP

### Internal Use Release

- [x] Deprecate `code` type, downgrade use cases to uppercase strings.
- [x] Refactor `datetime` type into a bit field.
- [x] Merge `enum` into `variant` type.
- [x] New `timespan` bit field.
- [ ] Introduce JSON IDL.
- [ ] Confirm float choice is unambiguous. (We already know that "VarFloat" would waste space.)
- [x] Finalize specification
- [ ] Perl 5
- [ ] Test round-trips to try to catch fatal design issues
- [ ] OCaml

### First Public Release

Before officially accepting contributions, I'd like to cover a few more implementations to make sure we are good to go.

- [ ] Create data files to help test all implementations
- [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] Have the docs proofread for clarity
- [ ] JavaScript / TypeScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] C / C++

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Java / Kotlin
- [ ] C# / F#
- [ ] Go
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Swift
